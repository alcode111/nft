                    <p>At $33k, this NFT sneaker is super good value!</p>

                        If you've got lots of money and you're a bit draft, NFTs are a great way to pay for 
                        something that doesn't have any intrinsic value or even exist. Tech fashionistas are
                        jumping on the NFT bandwagon and spending eye-watering sums of money on crypto images. 
                        Our advice: spend the weekend <a href="#">crafting an NFT</a> and by this time next week, 
                        you'll be a millionaire.

                        Is $33k for sneakers too basic for you? No problem! This CryptoPunk(left) is a steal at 
                        $6.6 million! Which makes Bag #748 (right) a total bargain at $1.4 million. And by the 
                        way, that's not a VS Code screenshot we included by mistake. The eight lines of white 
                        text on a black background is the actual NFT we're selling.

                    <p>Still not convinced? To be honest, nor are we. That's why we're selling them, not buying 
                        them.</p>
